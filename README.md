# personal-website

My website made using Zola.

## Dependencies

The only dependency for this project is [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

## Running

To set up the development server, just run `zola serve` in the root folder of the project.

## TODO

- [ ] Set `:not(pre)>code` font size to inherit
- [ ] Differentiate different heading levels (underline?)
- [ ] Possibly increase body font size
